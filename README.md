## What It Is
An single-player game written in Python and using the Pygame library.


## Languages used
* Python
* Pygame (Python library add-in)


## Overview
The game allows a user to select one of 9 level. Each level adds more monsters and goblins and they move faster. The goal of the game is to capture the monsters and avoid the red goblins. The monsters and goblins change their direction randomly about every 3 seconds. There is a force-field the user can trigger that will cause goblins to be repelled while still allowing the user to catch monsters. The force-field last for 3 seconds and is available for up to 3 times per play. Hitting S while playing turns sound on/off and hitting Q while playing ends the game. Sounds are played if the user wins or loses.
